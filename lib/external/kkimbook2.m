function imchi=kkimbook2(omega,rechi,alpha)
%The program inputs are the vector of the frequency (or energy)
%components, the vector of the real part of the susceptibility
%under examination, and the value of the moment considered.
%The two vectors must have the same length 
%and the frequency vector omega must be equispaced. 
%If not, apply MATLAB functions such as interp.
%If rechi is the real part of a linear susceptibility, 
%alpha must be 0. 
%If rechi is the real part of the nth 
%harmonic generation susceptibility, alpha=0,1,..2n. 
%If rechi is the real part of a pump and probe
%susceptibility, alpha=0 or 1.
